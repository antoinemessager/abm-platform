#Initialization function
#1st parameter: number of cells
#2nd parameter: length of the square
#3rd parameter: width of the square surrounding the cells
#4th parameter: radius of the cell
#
#This function return a 2D list of random located cells within the square's borders. The cells have a radius and they do not overlap.
#We initilaize the first location of the cell and then for each new potential cell we look within the list whether the cell is
#overlapping with another cell. If yes, we choose another random location for the cell
